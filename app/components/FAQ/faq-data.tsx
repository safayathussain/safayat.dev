      <>
        A great website isn&apos;t just about looks; it&apos;s about results. Our five golden rules are:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
          <li>Speed: If it doesn&apos;t load in under 2 seconds, you&apos;re losing customers.</li>
          <li>Clarity: It must pass the &quot;5-second test&quot;: visitors must know what you do instantly.</li>
          <li>Action: Every page needs a clear call-to-action guiding the user.</li>
          <li>Mobile-First: It must be flawless on a phone, where most users will see it.</li>
          <li>SEO-Ready: It must be built to be found on Google from day one.</li>

    question: "How do I find the right web designer for my business?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Look for three things:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
          <li>A Portfolio with Results: Don&apos;t just look for pretty sites; ask for proof that their work actually helped grow a business.</li>
          <li>A Transparent Process: They should be able to clearly explain their steps from start to finish.</li>
          <li>
            A Focus on ROI: The right partner talks less about colors and fonts and more about how they&apos;ll turn your website into a predictable source of
            revenue.
          </li>
        </ul>
